Aren't you _zerikdizmi_ from writing Rust programs in English? Would you like to try something different, in an exotic and
funny-sounding language? Would you want to bring some Uzbek touch to your
programs?

**zang** (Uzbek for _Rust_) is here to save your day, as it allows you to
write Rust programs in Uzbek, using Uzbek keywords, Uzbek function names,
Uzbek idioms.

Don't worry!
Uzbek Rust is fully compatible with English-Rust, so you can mix both at your
convenience.

Here's an example of what can be achieved with Rouille:

### Examples

See the [examples](./examples/src/main.rs) to get a rough sense of the whole
syntax. Marhamat, that's it.

## More contributions

First of all, _rahmat_ for considering participating to this joke, the
French government will thank you later! Feel free to throw in a few identifiers
here and there, and open a pull-request against the `asosiy` (Uzbek for
`main`) branch.

Please don't introduce swear words, though: we will not excuse your Uzbek.

## but why would you do that

- horsin around
- playing with raw proc macros
- making a bit of fun about programming languages that do this seriously,
  though I can see their utility.
